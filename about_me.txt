Hello!
I am Neev Shah from AIML department and an intern at Futurense Technologies
During this internship, I will work on Python programming, exploring its libraries, and learn new ways to visualise data.
Also, I will be learning about data visualization and the importance of presenting data in a visual format. By exploring libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I will gain practical experience in creating data visualisation charts.
I am truly excited to be the part of this internship, where I will apply my knowledge and learn new skills, exploring new challenges and opportunities.
There will be many hurdles which with thorough guidance and mentorship i will overcome and upskill myself

GOALS:
My goal is be a specialised ML engineer using AI at its core.
Current goal is to work around with the data and the different methods to use and conclude data.
Final goal is to learn and simultaneously experience the corporate collaborative approach.

Thank You!!
