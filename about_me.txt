Hello!
I am Neev Shah from AIML department and an intern at Futurense Technologies
During this internship, I will work on Python programming, exploring its libraries, and learn new ways to visualise data.
Also, I will be learning about data visualization and the importance of presenting data in a visual format. By exploring libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I will gain practical experience in creating data visualisation charts.
I am truly excited to be the part of this internship, where I will apply my knowledge and learn new skills, exploring new challenges and opportunities.
There will be many hurdles which with thorough guidance and mentorship i will overcome and upskill myself
Thank You!
